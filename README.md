# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a mashup of tic-tac-toe and undertale. Where players have to fight for their chosen box and if they were to lose then the enemy gets their mark on that box.
## To play the game you need to run make run command on terminal while being in tic-tac-toe directory.
If that doesnt work you can try changing line 33 in makefile from (cd $(OBJ_DIR) && ./Game.exe) to (cd $(OBJ_DIR) && Game.exe).
